class DownloaderConfig(object):
    """
    Downloader configuration class that represents the type of download backend,
    as well as, it's configuration. Instances of this class are used by the
    download factory to determine which download backend to use.

    Currently supported configuration values are:

     * max_concurrent:       maximum number of downloads to run concurrently
     * basic_auth_username:  http basic auth username (basic_auth_password must also be
                             provided)
     * basic_auth_password:  http basic auth password (basic_auth_username must also be
                             provided)
     * ssl_ca_cert:          certificate authority cert for secure connections (https
                             protocol only)
     * ssl_ca_cert_path:     path to a ssl ca cert (incompatible with ssl_ca_cert)
     * ssl_client_cert:      client certificate for secure connections (https protocol
                             only)
     * ssl_client_cert_path: path to a ssl client cert (incompatible with ssl_client_cert)
     * ssl_client_key:       client private key for secure connections (https protocol
                             only)
     * ssl_client_key_path:  path to a ssl client key (incompatible with ssl_client_key)
     * ssl_validation:       A boolean value. If set to True, the downloader will verify that the remote
                             server's SSL certificate is signed by a trusted authority, and that the
                             certificate's CommonName field equals the hostname we are connecting to. If False,
                             no such verification is made.
     * proxy_url:            A string representing the URL of a proxy server that should
                             be used while retrieving content. It should be of the form
                             <scheme>://<hostname>/ where the scheme is http or https.
     * proxy_port:           The port on the proxy server to connect to. This should be
                             an integer value.
     * proxy_username:       The username to use when authenticating with the proxy server
     * proxy_password:       The password to use when authenticating with the proxy server
     * max_speed:            The maximum speed to be used during downloads. This should be an integer
                             value, and should be specified in units of bytes per second.
